# What is HogwartsNFT?

HogwartsNFT is a decentralized application (dApp) that allows users to mint, collect, and trade unique digital assets, known as NFTs, inspired by the magical world of Hogwarts. Each NFT represents a unique item, such as a wand, a broomstick, or a magical creature, and is stored on the Ethereum blockchain.

# Features

Minting: Users can mint new NFTs, each with its own unique characteristics and attributes.
Collecting: Users can collect and store their NFTs in their digital wallets.
Trading: Users can trade their NFTs with other users on the platform.
Random House Assignment: Users can participate in a random house assignment, where they will be sorted into one of four houses: Gryffindor, Slytherin, Ravenclaw, or Hufflepuff.
Technical Details
Blockchain: HogwartsNFT is built on the Ethereum blockchain, using the ERC-721 standard for NFTs.
Smart Contracts: The project uses two smart contracts: HogwartsNFT for minting and managing NFTs, and RandomHouseAssignment for assigning users to a random house.
Frontend: The frontend is built using React and Web3.js, allowing users to interact with the smart contracts and manage their NFTs.
